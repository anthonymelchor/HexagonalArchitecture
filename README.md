# Hexagonal Architecture in Python with PyTest Integration Tests
Welcome to this project repository! In this project, we have implemented a robust and maintainable application using the Hexagonal Architecture pattern in Python. Our primary focus has been on creating a well-structured and highly testable software system.

## Key Highlights
- **Hexagonal Architecture:** We've adopted the Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters) to design our application. This architectural pattern promotes a clean separation of concerns and enables us to build a highly adaptable and modular system.

- **Python Implementation:** The entire project is written in Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language. We've leveraged Python's readability and flexibility to create a maintainable codebase.

- **Integration Testing with PyTest:** To ensure the reliability and quality of our application, we've integrated comprehensive integration tests. These tests are implemented using the PyTest library, a popular and user-friendly testing framework in the Python ecosystem.
